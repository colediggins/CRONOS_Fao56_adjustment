# CRONOS_Fao56_adjustment
This repository is to serve as the submittal of my semester project for the class "Soil Physics Theory" at Oklahoma State University. Over the course of this project I want to take in-field soil moisture data and use it to train an FAO 56 based model to effectively predict soil moisture in crop fields.
